# Cloudflare Nodes for n8n

This is a collection of n8n community nodes for Cloudflare services. Currently supported services: R2 object storage, D1 serverless database, Workers AI, KV storage, and Queues.

**Disclaimer**: This is a community-developed project and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Cloudflare or n8n. I'm just a fan that wanted to use cloudflare services in n8n. This repository is in development, which means that not all cloudflare services are implemented as nodes yet and some operations may currently not be available. Additionally you may encounter bugs or unhelpful error messages. Please report any issues you find and provide as much context as possible, include screenshots and error messages in code blocks if possible.

## Available Nodes

## Authentication

### üîë API Token Types

Cloudflare offers two types of API tokens with different scopes:

#### 1. **User-Level Tokens** (Recommended for most services)
Perfect for D1, AI, KV, and Queues. Use this pre-configured link:

**[üìù Create User-Level Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens?permissionGroupKeys=%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22d1%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22d1%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22queues%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22queues%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_kv_storage%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_kv_storage%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%5D&name=custom-n8n-cloudflare-nodes&accountId=%2A&zoneId=all)** *(Pre-configured with required permissions)*

#### 2. **Account-Level Tokens** 
For account-level permissions, replace `profile` in the URL above with your Account ID:
```
https://dash.cloudflare.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE/api-tokens?...
```

### üîê Authentication Modes

**Standard Mode** (D1, AI, KV, Queue):
- ‚úÖ API Token (from link above)
- ‚úÖ Account ID

**R2 Mode** (Object Storage):
- ‚úÖ Account ID  
- ‚úÖ R2 Access Key ID
- ‚úÖ R2 Secret Access Key
- ‚úÖ R2 Jurisdiction (default/eu/fedramp)

> [!WARNING]
> **R2 requires special S3-compatible API tokens**, not regular Cloudflare API tokens. These provide Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for S3 compatibility.

## Requirements

## Troubleshooting

### üö® Common Issues

#### Queue Operations Return 403 Forbidden
```
Error: Request failed with status code 403
```
**Solution:** Cloudflare Queues requires a paid Workers plan. [Upgrade your account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/workers/plans) or visit your [Queue dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/workers/queues).

#### R2 Authentication Errors
```
Error: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records
```
**Solution:** R2 requires S3-compatible API tokens, not regular Cloudflare tokens. Create one at the [R2 Token page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/).

#### Invalid Account ID
```
Error: Unknown account identifier
```
**Solution:** Double-check your Account ID in the Cloudflare dashboard sidebar. It should be a 32-character hexadecimal string.

#### Token Permission Errors
```
Error: API token does not have the required permissions
```
**Solution:** Use the [pre-configured token URL](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens?permissionGroupKeys=%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22d1%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22d1%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22queues%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22queues%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_kv_storage%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_kv_storage%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%5D&name=custom-n8n-cloudflare-nodes&accountId=%2A&zoneId=all) to ensure all required permissions are included.
